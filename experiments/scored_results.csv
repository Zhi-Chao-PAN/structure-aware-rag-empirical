1,"What was the Total revenue for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024?","60,922 million",Simple Lookup,Baseline (PyPDF),"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the total revenue was for NVIDIA in the fiscal year that ended on January 28, 2024. Let me start by reading through the context provided.

From the context, I see several mentions of specific revenues for different segments. For example, Networking revenue was up 133%, Gaming revenue was up 15%, Professional Visualization up 1%, and Automotive up 21%. Data Center revenue specifically is mentioned as $47.5 billion, which is a significant figure.

I also notice that the context includes mentions of total revenue in certain contexts. For instance, it talks about the percentage decreases or increases for different segments but doesn't directly state the total revenue. However, since Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive are all key segments for NVIDIA, adding their specific revenues might give a rough estimate.

Wait, but without exact figures for each segment's contribution beyond what's mentioned, it's tricky. The context does provide Data Center revenue as $47.5 billion, which is a substantial part of the total. The other segments' revenues are given in percentage increases relative to previous years, not absolute numbers. For example, Gaming was up 15% to $10.4 billion, but that's for the fiscal year 2023. Similarly, Professional Visualization is $1.6 billion for 2024, up slightly.

So, if I add up these known figures: Data Center at $47.5B, Gaming at $10.4B, Professional Visualization at $1.6B, and Automotive at $1.1B, that's a total of around $61.6B. But wait, the context doesn't specify whether these are the only sources of revenue or if there are other segments contributing as well.

Looking back, the initial context mentions ""Total revenue for fiscal year 2024"" without giving an exact figure but discusses increases in various segments. Since Data Center is a major driver with $47.5B and others add up to around $13.1B (Gaming + Professional Visualization + Automotive), it's reasonable to infer that the total revenue would be higher than these sums, possibly over $60B.

Alternatively, considering NVIDIA's position as a leader in GPUs and AI, their total revenue is likely in the tens of billions. However, without explicit numbers, I can't give an exact figure. The closest data point from the context is Data Center revenue at $47.5B, which is a significant portion but not all.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. The context mentions that ""Gross margin increased... driven by Data Center growth."" It also states that Networking revenue was up 133%, and Automotive up 21%. So, the total revenue would be the sum of all these segments' contributions, which likely surpasses $60B.

But since I can't add exact figures beyond what's provided, I'll have to state that while specific segment revenues are given, the total revenue for fiscal year 2024 is not directly provided in the context but can be inferred from the significant contributions of Data Center and other segments.
</think>

The total revenue for NVIDIA during the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, cannot be precisely determined from the provided context. However, based on the information given, it includes significant contributions from multiple segments such as Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. While specific figures are not directly provided, the context suggests that the total revenue is substantial, exceeding $60 billion when considering major segments like Data Center contributing over $47.5 billion alone.

Answer: The total revenue for fiscal year 2024 was not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the significant contributions from various segments such as Data Center (over $47.5 billion), Gaming ($10.4 billion), Professional Visualization ($1.6 billion), and Automotive ($1.1 billion), it is inferred that the total revenue exceeds $60 billion.",203.52,0.0
2,"What was the Total revenue for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023?","26,974 million",Simple Lookup,Baseline (PyPDF),"<think>
Alright, I need to find the total revenue for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. Let me go through the context provided.

First, the context includes data for the fiscal year 2024. It mentions that Networking revenue was up 133% in fiscal 2024 compared to 2023. Similarly, Gaming revenue increased by 15%, Professional Visualization by 1%, and Automotive by 21%. Data Center revenue jumped 217% to $47.5 billion. However, these are all for fiscal year 2024.

I don't see any direct figures provided for the fiscal year 2023 total revenue in the context. The closest is that Networking revenue in 2024 was up from 2023 by 133%, but without knowing the actual Networking revenue in 2023, I can't calculate the exact increase or the total.

The only figure given for a specific year is the Data Center revenue in 2024, which is $47.5 billion, but that's for 2024, not 2023. Without the total revenues broken down for both years, I can't compute the exact number for 2023.

So, based on the information provided, there isn't enough data to determine the total revenue for fiscal year 2023.
</think>

The context provided does not include the total revenue for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. The available figures are only for fiscal year 2024, which shows significant increases over 2023 in various segments but does not disclose the exact 2023 revenues.

Answer: The total revenue for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, cannot be determined from the provided context as it only includes data for fiscal year 2024.",71.58,0.0

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Research and Development (R&D) expenses were higher in 2024 or 2023 for NVIDIA based on the provided context.

First, I'll look through the context information. The context includes details about revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, net income, and various market segments like Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. It also touches upon macroeconomic factors and some geopolitical issues, but there's nothing explicitly mentioned about R&D expenses.

I'm trying to recall if any part of the context refers specifically to R&D spending. The context mentions increases in operating expenses driven by growth in employees and compensation increases. Operating expenses include things like R&D, so an increase in operating expenses could indicate higher R&D costs. However, without specific numbers or a direct mention of R&D as a separate line item, it's hard to be certain.

I also check the financial highlights where they list revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, and net income per diluted share for both 2024 and 2023. The context does not show a break-down of operating expenses into individual categories like R&D, sales, and marketing. Without this breakdown, I can't determine whether R&D specifically increased or decreased.

Therefore, based on the provided information, there's no direct data comparing R&D expenses between the two years. The only thing I can infer is that operating expenses overall were up by 2% in 2024, but without knowing how much of that was allocated to R&D, it's not possible to answer definitively.
</think>

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information comparing NVIDIA's Research and Development (R&D) expenses between 2024 and 2023. While operating expenses increased by 2% in 2024, the context does not specify how this increase was allocated among different operational areas such as R&D, sales, and marketing. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether R&D expenses were higher in 2024 compared to 2023 based on the given data.

Answer: The context does not provide specific information to compare R&D expenses between 2024 and 2023.",93.48,0.0
4,What is the exact value of Gross profit for 2024?,"44,301 million",Simple Lookup,Baseline (PyPDF),"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the exact value of NVIDIA's gross profit for 2024 based on the provided context. Let me start by going through the information step by step.

First, I know that gross profit is calculated as (Gross Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold). However, in the given context, there isn't a direct mention of the cost of goods sold or operating expenses. Instead, it provides revenue figures and some details about how these revenues contribute to various segments and factors affecting profitability.

Looking at the table on Page 36, I see that the company reported total revenue of $60.922 billion for the year ended January 28, 2024. The gross margin increased from 56.9% in 2023 to 72.7% in 2024. The increase in gross margin is primarily attributed to Data Center revenue growth and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue.

Since gross profit isn't directly provided, I need to make an assumption here. Typically, the term ""gross margin"" refers to (Gross Profit / Gross Revenue) * 100. So if the gross margin is 72.7%, then Gross Profit would be approximately 72.7% of Total Revenue.

Calculating that: $60.922 billion * (72.7 / 100). Let me compute this:

First, I'll convert 72.7% to a decimal, which is 0.727.

Then, multiply $60.922 billion by 0.727:

$60.922 * 0.727 = approximately $44.3 billion.

Wait, let me do the exact calculation more precisely.

Calculating 60.922 * 0.727:

Breakdown:
- 60 * 0.727 = 43.62
- 0.922 * 0.727 â?0.674

Adding them together: 43.62 + 0.674 â?44.294 billion.

So, approximately $44.29 billion.

But I should check if there's any other information that might affect this calculation. The context mentions that gross margin increased due to Data Center revenue and lower inventory provisions. However, without knowing the exact cost of goods sold or changes in inventory that impact gross profit directly, my calculation is based solely on the given gross margin percentage.

Therefore, the approximate value for Gross Profit in 2024 would be around $44.29 billion.
</think>

The estimated value of NVIDIA's gross profit for 2024, based on the provided context, is approximately **$44.29 billion**. This calculation assumes a gross margin of 72.7% applied to the total revenue of $60.922 billion.

Answer: Approximately $44.29 billion",115.92,1.0
5,"Did the Operating income increase or decrease from 2023 to 2024, and by roughly how much?","Increased by roughly 28,696 million (32,972 - 4,224)",Cross-Column Comparison,Baseline (PyPDF),"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out whether NVIDIA's Operating Income increased or decreased from 2023 to 2024, and by how much. Let me start by going through the context provided.

Looking at the context, there are several financial metrics mentioned, including Revenue, Gross Margin, Operating Expenses, Operating Income, Net Income, etc. The key points I need are about the changes in these metrics from 2023 to 2024.

First, I see that the table on Page 36 lists the Year Ended figures for 2024 and 2023, with the changes next to them. The Operating Expenses increased by $11,329 million compared to $11,132 million in 2023, so there's an increase there. However, the question is about Operating Income, not expenses.

Looking further down, I find that Operating Income for 2024 was $32,972 million, while in 2023 it was $4,224 million. To find out if it increased or decreased, I need to compare these two numbers.

$32,972 (2024) is significantly higher than $4,224 (2023), so the Operating Income has increased. The increase amount would be the difference between these two figures: 32,972 - 4,224 = 28,748 million dollars. 

Wait, but the context mentions that in Fiscal Year 2024, the Operating Expenses were up by $2% from 2023, which is a small increase compared to the large jump in Operating Income. This aligns with typical business performance where expenses can rise due to growth, but income increases even more.

So, putting it all together: Operating Income increased, and the rough increase amount would be about $28.75 billion.

NVIDIA's Operating Income increased from 2023 to 2024 by approximately $28.75 billion.",74.51,1.0
6,What was the Net income for 2024?,"29,760 million",Simple Lookup,Baseline (PyPDF),"<think>
Alright, I need to figure out the net income for 2024 based on the provided context. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, I'll look at the fiscal year 2024 summary at the end of the document. The table there shows the Year Ended figures for both Jan 28, 2024 and Jan 29, 2023. Specifically, it lists Net income.

In 2024, the net income is $29,760 million. Comparing this to 2023, which was $4,368 million, the net income has increased significantly.

I should make sure I'm not confusing any other figures like operating income or gross margin. The question specifically asks for net income, so I'll focus on that line in the table.

Double-checking the numbers: Net income for 2024 is indeed $29,760 million.

7,What was the Basic net income per share for 2024?,$12.05 ,Simple Lookup,Baseline (PyPDF),"<think>
Alright, I need to find out the basic net income per share (EPS) for 2024 based on the given context. Let me start by skimming through the information provided.

Looking at page 34, there's a table with financial data labeled as ""Year Ended Jan 28, 2024"" and ""Jan 29, 2023."" The line item I'm interested in is ""Net income,"" which for 2024 is $29,760 million. Then, on page 36, the same data is repeated but formatted differently.

I notice that for EPS, there's a line that says ""Net income per diluted share"" for both 2024 and 2023. For 2024, it's $11.93, and for 2023, it's $1.74. Since the question asks specifically for the basic net income per share, I should focus on this number.

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the net income by the number of shares outstanding. In this case, since it's already provided as ""$29,760 million,"" and the corresponding EPS is given without any adjustments, it seems to be the basic figure. 

So, the basic net income per share for 2024 would be $11.93.

8,Did the Basic net income per share increase from 2023 to 2024?,"Yes, increased from $1.76 to $12.05",Cross-Column Comparison,Baseline (PyPDF),"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the basic net income per share increased from 2023 to 2024 based on the provided context. Let me start by looking through the context information given.

First, I see that in the ""Fiscal Year 2024 Summary"" section, there are some financial figures listed for the years ended January 28, 2024, and January 29, 2023. Specifically, it mentions net income per diluted share for both years: $11.93 for 2024 and $1.74 for 2023. 

To determine if there's an increase, I need to compare these two figures. So, $11.93 (2024) minus $1.74 (2023) equals approximately $10.19. Since this is a positive number, it indicates that the net income per share increased from 2023 to 2024.

I should make sure there's no other information in the context that might contradict this. Scanning through the rest of the text doesn't show any numbers that would change this calculation or provide a different perspective on net income per share. All other financial figures, like revenue and operating expenses, also increased, which aligns with an increase in net income.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the basic net income per share did indeed increase from 2023 to 2024.

Okay, so I need to figure out the total revenue for the fiscal year ended on January 28, 2024. Let me start by looking through the context provided.

First, I see there's a table titled ""Fiscal Year 2024 Summary"" which includes various financial metrics like Revenue, Gross margin, Operating expenses, etc. The first column under this table is labeled ""Year Ended,"" and the next two columns are for ""Jan 28, 2024"" and ""Jan 29, 2023."" 

Looking at the row for ""Revenue,"" I see that it's listed as ""$60,922"" in the ""Jan 28, 2024"" column. That must be the total revenue for the fiscal year ended on January 28, 2024.

I should make sure there isn't any other mention of total revenue elsewhere that might contradict this number. Scanning through the context, I notice another table under ""Market Platform Highlights"" and ""LlamaParse SOTA Output,"" but those don't provide additional figures for total revenue. The detailed sections like ""Data Center revenue,"" ""Gaming revenue,"" etc., are subcategories of the overall Revenue, confirming that $60.9 billion is indeed the total.

So, putting it all together, the total revenue for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, is $60.922 billion.

Okay, so I need to figure out what the total revenue was for the fiscal year ended on January 29, 2023. Let me start by looking at the context information provided.

First, I see a table that lists various financial metrics for the fiscal year 2024 and compares them to January 28, 2023 (wait, actually, it's comparing 2024 to 2023). The columns are Year Ended, Jan 28, 2024, Jan 29, 2023, and Change. So, the ""Year Ended"" column is for 2024, and then they're showing the numbers for January 28, 2024, which is the end of 2024, and January 29, 2023, which is the end of 2023.

Looking at the table, under the Revenue row, it says $60,922 for Jan 28, 2024, and $26,974 for Jan 29, 2023. So, the total revenue for fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, would be $26,974. 

I should make sure I'm interpreting the table correctly. The ""Year Ended"" column is Fiscal Year 2024, so the other two columns are showing data as of January 28 and 29, which were the end dates. Since the fiscal year ended on January 29, 2023, that's when the previous year's financials would be recorded.

So yes, the revenue for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, is $26,974 million.

3,Compare the Research and development expenses between 2024 and 2023. Which year was higher?,"2024 was higher (8,675 vs 7,339)",Cross-Column Comparison,Proposed (LlamaParse),"<think>
Alright, I need to figure out how to compare the research and development (R&D) expenses between 2024 and 2023 based on the provided context. Let me start by looking at the table of contents.

First, there's a ""Fiscal Year 2024 Summary"" table that lists various financial metrics for the year ended January 28, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The columns include Revenue, Gross margin, Operating expenses, and so on. I'm looking for R&D expenses, but I don't see a specific line item for that.

Next, I check the ""Market Platform Highlights"" section. It goes into detail about each market segment like Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. However, there's no mention of R&D expenses here either. The focus is more on revenue growth and new product launches rather than expenditure.

Then, I look at the ""Global Trade"" section. It discusses export controls and licensing requirements but doesn't touch on R&D costs. There's also a mention of supply chain management due to geopolitical factors, which might indirectly affect R&D, but it's not directly providing expense figures.

Moving on to ""Macroeconomic Factors,"" this part talks about how inflation, interest rates, and global supply chain issues impact the company's operations, including R&D. It mentions that product pricing doesn't fluctuate much with short-term cost changes, but again, no specific numbers are given for 2024 vs. 2023 R&D expenses.

Lastly, under ""Israel and Hamas Conflict,"" there's information about the impact on employees and operations, including R&D, but once more, no figures or comparison between R&D expenses in those years.

Since the context provided doesn't include a specific line item for R&D expenses in either year, I can't directly compare them. However, based on the summary table, operating expenses increased by 2% from 2023 to 2024, but without knowing how much of that is allocated to R&D versus other areas like sales or marketing, it's impossible to determine which year had higher R&D expenses.

Therefore, I need to inform the user that the necessary data isn't provided in the context. It's possible they might have intended for R&D expenses to be mentioned, but since it's not included, I can't provide a comparison.

The provided context does not include specific information about research and development (R&D) expenses for either 2024 or 2023. Therefore, it is not possible to compare the R&D expenses between these two years based on the given data.

4,What is the exact value of Gross profit for 2024?,"44,301 million",Simple Lookup,Proposed (LlamaParse),"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the exact value of Gross Profit for 2024 based on the provided context. Let me start by looking through the tables and details given.

First, there's a table labeled ""Fiscal Year 2024 Summary."" It includes several financial metrics like Revenue, Gross margin, Operating expenses, Operating income, Net income, and Net income per diluted share. I'm specifically interested in Gross profit, so I'll need to see if it's directly provided here or if I have to calculate it from other figures.

Looking at the table, I see that Gross margin is given as 72.7% for 2024. Gross margin typically represents the percentage of revenue that is left after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS). So, if I can find the total revenue for 2024 and subtract the COGS, I should be able to get the gross profit.

Wait, but the context doesn't explicitly state the COGS for 2024. It does mention operating expenses, which include costs like salaries, R&D, marketing, etc., but not the direct cost of goods sold. So maybe I can infer the gross profit from the provided data another way or check if it's mentioned elsewhere.

I see in the ""Fiscal Year 2024 Summary"" table that Revenue is $60.9 billion. Gross margin is 72.7%, which means the COGS would be revenue minus gross profit. So, gross profit would be Revenue multiplied by (1 - Gross margin). Let me calculate that: 60,922 (assuming this is in millions or billions) times (1 - 0.727).

Wait, actually, I need to clarify whether the figures are in dollars without commas. The table shows ""Revenue"" as $ followed by a number, so it's likely in dollars. But the exact amount isn't clear if it's in thousands, millions, etc. Wait, looking again: ""$60,922"" â?perhaps that's in thousands? Or is it in actual dollars? Hmm.

Wait, no, in the table headers, ""Revenue"" is listed as ""$"", so it's just $ with the number following, which would make it a large figure. So, 60,922 would be in millions because that's a plausible revenue figure for NVIDIA without commas. Wait, but actually, NVIDIA's annual revenue is typically in the tens of billions. For example, in 2024, their revenue was around $60 billion. So, if the table shows ""$60,922"", perhaps it's in thousands, making it $60.922 billion.

Wait, that makes sense because 60,922 thousand dollars is $60.922 billion. Similarly, other figures like Operating expenses are listed as ""$11,329"" which would be $11.329 billion.

So, Gross margin is 72.7%, so Gross profit would be Revenue minus COGS, which is equal to Revenue multiplied by (1 - Gross margin). So:

Gross Profit = Revenue * (1 - Gross Margin)
= $60,922 * (1 - 0.727)
= $60,922 * 0.273

Calculating that: 60,922 * 0.273. Let me do the math step by step.

First, multiply 60,922 by 0.2: 60,922 * 0.2 = 12,184.4
Then, 60,922 * 0.07 = 4,265.54
Next, 60,922 * 0.003 = 182.766

Adding them together: 12,184.4 + 4,265.54 = 16,449.94; plus 182.766 gives approximately 16,632.706 million dollars.

Wait, but wait a second. The revenue is $60,922 billion? That can't be right because that's way too high. No, actually, the table shows ""$60,922"" without commas, so it's likely in millions of dollars. So if the Revenue is $60,922 million, then in billions, that would be $60,922 * 1,000 = $60,922 billion, which again seems too large for 2024 as NVIDIA's revenue was around $60 billion.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table. Let me look again. The table lists Revenue as ""$"" followed by 60,922. So maybe it's in thousands of dollars, meaning $60.922 million. That would make more sense because $60 million is a typical annual revenue for a company like NVIDIA.

If that's the case, then:

Gross Profit = Revenue * (1 - Gross Margin)
= $60,922,000 (assuming 60,922 thousand) * 0.273

Calculating: 60,922,000 * 0.273 â?16,632,706 thousand dollars, which is approximately $16,632.706 million or $16.6327 billion.

But wait, I'm getting confused because the actual revenue in 2024 was around $60 billion, so if Revenue is $60,922 million, that's about $60.922 billion, which aligns with the real figure.

So, using that:

Gross Profit = 60,922 * 0.273 â?16,632.706 million dollars
= $16,632.706 billion? No, wait: 60,922 is in millions, so 60,922 million * 0.273 is approximately 16,632.706 million.

Therefore, Gross profit for 2024 would be approximately $16,632.7 million or $16.6327 billion.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if the Revenue figure in the table is correctly interpreted. Let me check again: the context says ""Revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $60.9 billion."" So that's correct. Therefore, the table in the context must have a typo or formatting issue because it shows ""$60,922"" but the actual revenue is $60.9 billion.

Assuming that, then Gross Profit would be:

Gross Profit = Revenue * (1 - Gross Margin)
= 60.9 * 0.727 â?44.163 billion

So approximately $44.163 billion.
</think>

The exact value of Gross Profit for 2024 is calculated as follows:

Gross Profit = Revenue Ã (1 - Gross Margin)  
= $60,922,000 Ã (1 - 0.727)  
â?$16,632,706 million or $16.6327 billion.

However, based on the actual revenue of $60.9 billion, the correct calculation is:

Gross Profit = $60.9 billion Ã (1 - 0.727) â?$44.163 billion.

Answer: The exact value of Gross profit for 2024 is \boxed{44.163} billion.",291.96,0.5

In 2024, the Operating Income is $32,972 million. Comparing this to 2023's figure of $4,224 million, it looks like there's a significant increase. To find out by how much, I subtract the 2023 number from the 2024 one: 32,972 minus 4,224 equals approximately 28,748 million dollars.

So, putting this together, the Operating Income increased, and the growth is around $29 billion.

Alright, I need to figure out the basic net income per share for 2024 based on the provided context. Let me go through the context step by step.

First, I'll look at the table of contents and see where the financial information is located. The context includes a ""Fiscal Year 2024 Summary"" table which lists various financial metrics. Scanning through, I spot the line ""Net income per diluted share | $ | 11.93 | 1.74 | Up 586%"". 

The numbers listed are for the year ended Jan 28, 2024 (Year Ended), and compared to Jan 29, 2023. The figure after ""Net income per diluted share"" is $11.93, which represents the basic net income per share for 2024. 

I should make sure that this is indeed the correct metric. Net income per share is a common financial measure, often abbreviated as EPS (Earnings Per Share). In this case, it's specifically called out as ""Net income per diluted share"", which aligns with EPS.

So, putting it all together, the basic net income per share for 2024 is $11.93.

Okay, I need to figure out if the basic net income per share increased from 2023 to 2024. Let me start by looking at the table provided in the context. The table has a row labeled ""Net income per diluted share"" with values for Year Ended and Jan 28, 2024, as well as Jan 29, 2023. 

So, the basic net income per share for 2023 is $1.74 and for 2024 it's $11.93. Comparing these two numbers, I can see that 11.93 is much higher than 1.74. That means there's a significant increase from 2023 to 2024.

I should make sure I'm not missing any other factors. The context also mentions that the net income itself increased by 581%, which is a huge jump. Given that both the net income and the per share value are increasing, it reinforces the idea that there's a significant growth in earnings per share from the previous year.
